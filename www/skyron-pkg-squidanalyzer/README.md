# SquidAnalyzer packages for skyron software

As many people knows, Heraklet has trimed a lot of packages from official repo since skyronÂ® 2.5. 

This repo updates some packages for newer skyron software versions with manual procedure installs.

This is not supported by Heraklet or skyron team. Use it at your own risk.

Feedbacks and contributions are always welcome.

The SquidAnalyzer package will create graphical reports to squid/e2guardian proxy access.log

# Install instructions

If you enabled the repo, you can add this package under System -> Package Manager

Once it finishes, all must be in place. If you do not see the menu after it finishes, 

try to install any skyron package from GUI, like cron for example.
